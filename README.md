# GIS
A Geographic Information System (GIS) is a computer system that captures, stores, checks, and displays data related to positions on Earth's surface. 
It consists of integrated computer hardware and software that store, manage, analyze, edit, output, and visualize geographic data. 
GIS connects data to a map, integrating location data with all types of descriptive information, providing a foundation for mapping and analysis that is used in science and almost every industry. 
By relating seemingly unrelated data, GIS can help individuals and organizations better understand spatial patterns and relationships.
